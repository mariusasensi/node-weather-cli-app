# Node weather cli app

This application is part of the Node from zero to expert course that you can find here: [Node: De cero a experto (Spanish)](https://fernando-herrera.com/#/curso/node-cero-experto).

At this point, I want to add more details to learn more about Node.

## Use

You need to have installed Node and then:

```shell
npm ci
node app
```

## Project

### Features

* Search a location (using Nominatim to get the coordinates).
